This is a collection of implementations of various simulation-based algorithms, mainly from James C. Spall's "Introduction to Stochastic Search and Optimization."
It's short now, but I'll be adding more!

## Implementations
* ### Markov chain Monte Carlo
    - Take expectations of messy functions over random variables with nasty pdfs using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm.

* ### Simulated annealing
    - Find approximate global optima of complicated objective functions over nasty feasible regions with the simulated annealing algorithm.
